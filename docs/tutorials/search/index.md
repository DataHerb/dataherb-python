## Search


### Search by keyword

```bash
dataherb search demo
```

From the returns, we can find the dataset id which can be used to download the dataset.

For example, we find this `git-dataherb-python-demo-dataset` id as we just added this dataset in the creation step.


### Search by ID

Search by dataherb id

```bash
dataherb search -i covid19_eu_data
```
